This was a project that I did for a client who needed an eCommerce website. 

This Ruby on Rails app was done in version 2.2.2, due to the limitations of the Hosting site. 

This app is a fully functional shop app, including support for:
- RoR's Sweeper Caching.
- User authentication (Authlogic plugin), and User authorization roles (CanCan plugin).
- Admin role has the ability to update content through an AJAX edit, delete, and drag and drop.
- Uploading of Item Photos and automatic thumbnail resizing (Paperclip plugin).
